  <title>Demo LTI Tool</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>Hi, <%= @username %>, this is an LTI tool. I hope you learned a lot.</p>
<% if @tp.instructor? %>
  <p>You are a teacher, so you could configure this tool now if it were cool enough to have configurations.</p>
  <p>If you come back as a student you may get to take a test.</p>
<% elsif @tp.student? %>
  <p>You're lucky this isn't an assessment launch, you just get to sit here and do nothing.</p>
<% elsif @tp.roles && @tp.roles.any? %>
  <p>Your roles are <%= @tp.roles.join(",") %></p>
<% else %>
  <p>You don't have a role so I don't know what to do with you.</p>
<% end %>

<p>  Here are the params that were passed to the tool: </p>
<script type="text/javascript" src="/js/iframeResizer.contentWindow.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
    if ('parentIFrame' in window){
        window.parentIFrame.size(window.height, window.width)
    }
</script>
<%= erb :_params_table %>
<%= erb :_return_to_lms %>
